# Node-e-commerce

This is a sample application that demonstrates an E-commerce website using the EJS Template and NodeJS. The application
loads products using MongoDB database and displays them. Users can click on any product to get more information
including pricing, description, add to cart, they can select items and add them to their shopping cart,they you visit
carts page and place their order which redirects user to a payment portal, once the payment is done user will redirect
to orders page where he can download his invoice.

## Live Demonstration

The E-commerce demo can be [viewed online here](https://ejs-node-e-commerce.herokuapp.com/).

## Getting Started
